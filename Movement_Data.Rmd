#Loading and preprocessing the data
First, load the data from the github repo. We download the zipped file and then unzip it.
```{r}
require(RCurl)
temp <- tempfile()
download.file("https://github.com/opencedar/RepData_PeerAssessment1/blob/master/activity.zip?raw=true", temp, method = "libcurl", mode="wb")
unzip(temp, "activity.csv")
moveData <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```

Now we can define the date column correctly.
```{r}
moveData$date <- as.Date(moveData$date, format=("%Y-%m-%d"))

```

#What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
